    <h1>Bread Pudding</h1>
    <p>
      My family LOVES bread pudding, and this recipe is one that I have fine
      tuned to their taste. I have to double this recipe, and bake it in a 9x13
      inch pan for my family! It's great for breakfast or dessert and is
      delicious with milk poured on top! Enjoy!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 slices day-old bread</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <p>
      1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br />
      2. Break bread into small pieces into an 8 inch square baking pan. Drizzle
      melted butter or margarine over bread. If desired, sprinkle with raisins.
      <br />
      3. In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, and
      vanilla. Beat until well mixed. Pour over bread, and lightly push down
      with a fork until bread is covered and soaking up the egg mixture. <br />
      4. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the top springs
      back when lightly tapped.
